# JaMoveo
JaMoveo enables musicians to rehearse together remotely, share songs, and collaborate in real time. The app provides two main user flows:

- **Player (User) Flow:** Join a rehearsal session, select your instrument, and play along as the admin shares songs.
- **Admin Flow:** Create and manage rehearsal sessions, search and select songs, and control the session for all participants.

The application built using React, Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.
